FMOD Commercial License
This license is intended for titles using FMOD that charge money, directly or indirectly.
An FMOD license must be purchased for each destination platform. A reduced rate is available for developers licensing multiple platforms.
A ‘platform’ is the target hardware/OS (ie Windows 32/64bit are considered the same platform, Mac OSX, Xbox 360, etc). With iOS, iPod/iPhone/iPad are considered the same platform IF the app is a universal binary, otherwise if they are treated as separate apps (ie ‘game’ vs ‘game HD’), so they must be licensed separately.
